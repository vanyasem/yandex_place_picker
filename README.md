# Yandex Place Picker
[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/yandex_place_picker.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/yandex_place_picker)

Google Maps SDK used to feature a Place Picker. It was deprecated and removed. There is a custom library called [PING](https://github.com/rtchagas/pingplacepicker) that implements similar functionality using the Geocoder API. **It's expensive.**

**Yandex Place Picker** provides you with the same functionality utilising Yandex MapKit. At no cost.

## A key difference

There is a capability to utilize icons, but Google's icon names differ from Yandex's (and there isn't a full list anywhere to find), which requires manual renaming of all the icons. A few of them (banks, for example) are included. Feel free to contribute with more icons.
